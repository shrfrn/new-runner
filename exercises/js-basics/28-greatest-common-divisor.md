# Exercise 28: Greatest Common Divisor

## Instructions
A common divisor of two numbers is number which can divide both numbers without a remainder.

In this exercise, you will:
1. Write a program that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers
2. The program should work with any two positive integers
3. Test your program with different pairs of numbers

## Example
If the program is run with:
- Input: 6 and 15

Expected output:
```
3
```

## Tips
- Think about how to find the GCD using a loop
- Consider using the modulus operator (%) to check for divisibility
- The loop should run from the smaller number down to 1
- What should happen if one number is a multiple of the other?
- Test your program with various pairs of numbers
- The program should work with any valid positive integers
