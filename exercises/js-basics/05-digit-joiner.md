# Exercise 5: Digit Joiner

## Instructions
In this exercise, you will:
1. Use `prompt()` to read 3 separate digits from the user (one at a time)
2. Join these digits together to form a single number
3. Display the resulting number

## Example
If the user enters:
- First digit: 3
- Second digit: 2
- Third digit: 6

Expected output:
```
The joined number is: 326
```

## Bonus Challenge
It's easier to solve this when the user inputs are strings (which is how `prompt()` behaves). Try to solve this using numeric input and operations (convert the inputs to numbers first).

## Tips
- Consider different ways to join digits together (as strings or using math)
- Test your solution with different sets of digits
