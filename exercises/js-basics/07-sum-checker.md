# Exercise 7: Sum Checker

## Instructions
In this exercise, you will:
1. Use `prompt()` to read three numbers from the user
2. Check if the third number equals the sum of the first two numbers
3. Display the result in a formatted way

## Example
If the user enters:
- First number: 6
- Second number: 4
- Third number: 10

Expected output:
```
6 + 4 = 10
```

If the user enters:
- First number: 3
- Second number: 5
- Third number: 10

Expected output:
```
3 + 5 != 10
```

## Tips
- Remember to convert user inputs to numbers before performing calculations
- Test your program with different input combinations
