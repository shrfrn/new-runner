# Exercise 4: Time Calculator

## Instructions
In this exercise, you will:
1. Use `prompt()` to read a distance value from the user
2. Use `prompt()` again to read a speed value from the user
3. Calculate the time required to travel the distance at the given speed
4. Display the calculated time

The formula for calculating the time is:
`Time = Distance / Speed`

## Example
If the user enters:
- Distance: 100 (kilometers)
- Speed: 50 (kilometers per hour)

Expected output:
```
Time required: 2 hours
```

## Tips
- Remember to convert user inputs to numbers
- Think about the formula needed to calculate time from distance and speed
