# Exercise 49: Nth Largest Element

## Instructions
In this exercise, you will:
1. Implement the function `getNthLargest(nums, nthNum)` which returns the nth largest element from an array of unique numbers
2. The function should work with any array of unique numbers and any valid nth position
3. You can assume that the array contains unique numbers and nthNum is a valid position

## Example
If the function is called with:
- nums: [3, 5, 2, 4, 6, 8]
- nthNum: 3

Expected output:
```
5
```

If the function is called with:
- nums: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- nthNum: 1

Expected output:
```
5
```

## Tips
-  This can be done more easily by first sorting the array
