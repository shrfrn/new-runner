# Exercise 50: Making Water

## Instructions
In this exercise, you will:
1. Implement the function `makeWater()` which simulates picking random atoms to form water molecules
2. The function should randomly pick 3 atoms from a collection of the following available atoms - `H, B, C, N, O, F`
3. When you have 2 H atoms and 1 O atom, you can form a water molecule (H2O) and the function ends
4. It returns the number of rounds it had to run until it was able to generate a water molecules
