# Exercise 41: Number to Words

## Instructions
In this exercise, you will:
1. Write a function named `sayNum(num)` which prints each digit in words
2. The function should work with any positive integer
3. You can use either a switch statement inside a loop or an array named `digitNames`
4. Try implementing both approaches for practice

## Example
If the function is called with:
- Input: 123

Expected output:
```
One Two Three
```

If the function is called with:
- Input: 7294

Expected output:
```
Seven Two Nine Four
```

## Tips
