# Exercise 42: Starts With S

## Part I:
1. Write a function named `startsWithS(str)` which checks if a string starts with the letter 's'
2. The function should work with any string input
3. The check should be case-insensitive (both 's' and 'S' should return true)

#### Example
If the function is called like this - `startsWithS('Super')`

Expected output:
```
true
```

If the function is called like this - `startsWithS('Hello')`

Expected output:
```
false
```

## Part II
Now, refactor your function to work with any letter by adding a letter parameter. Rename the function to reflect its new functionality

## Tips
- Think about how to check the first character of a string
- Consider case sensitivity in the check
- What should happen with empty strings?
