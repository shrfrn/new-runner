# Exercise 38: Array Filter

## Instructions
In this exercise, you will:
1. Implement a function named `biggerThan100` that receives an array of numbers
2. The function should return a new array containing only the numbers which are greater than 100
3. Test your function with different arrays

## Example
If the function is called with:
- Input: [50, 120, 80, 200, 90]

Expected output:
```
[120, 200]
```

If the function is called with:
- Input: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

Expected output:
```
[]
```
