# Exercise 48: Array Sorting

## Part I:

1. Implement the function `sortNums(nums)` which returns a sorted version of the original nums array
2. The function should work by looping through the array, finding the minimum, splicing it out, and adding it to a new array

## Part II - Bubble Sort:

1. Research and implement the bubble sort algorithm
1. Adjust the implementation to match our coding conventions

## Example
If the function is called with:
- Input: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]

Expected output:
```
[11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```
