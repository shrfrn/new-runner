# Exercise 36: Name Length Analysis

## Instructions
In this exercise, you will:
1. Implement a function that receives a string of comma-separated names
2. The function should print the longest name and the shortest name
3. Use the `indexOf` function to help with the implementation

## Example
If the function is called with:
- Input: 'Igal,Moshe,Haim'

Expected output:
```
Longest name: Moshe
Shortest name: Haim
```

## Tips
- Think about how to locate the start and end of a name in the string
- Think about how to handle the last name in the string
