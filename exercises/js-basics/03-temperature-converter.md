# Exercise 3: Temperature Converter

## Instructions
In this exercise, you will:
1. Use `prompt()` to read a temperature in Celsius from the user
2. Convert the temperature to Fahrenheit 
3. Display the converted temperature

## Example
If the user enters:
- Celsius temperature: 25

Expected output:
```
25°C is equal to 77°F
```

## Tips
- Remember to convert the user input to a number
- The formula for conversion is: `Fahrenheit = Celsius × (9/5) + 32`
- Consider formatting the output to look neat and easy to understand
- Test with different temperatures, including negative values and zero
