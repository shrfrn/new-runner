# Exercise 9: Difference Checker

## Instructions
In this exercise, you will:
1. Use `prompt()` to read two positive numbers from the user
2. Calculate the absolute difference between them
3. Display the inputs and the difference
4. Check if the difference is smaller than both input values
5. If the difference is smaller than both input values, display a message saying that the numbers are "relatively close".

## Example
If the user enters:
- First number: 5
- Second number: 9

Expected output:
```
Number 1: 5, Number 2: 9, Difference: 4
The numbers are relatively close!
```

If the user enters:
- First number: 3
- Second number: 15

Expected output:
```
Number 1: 3, Number 2: 15, Difference: 12
```

## Tips
- Think about how to calculate the absolute difference between two numbers
- Make sure to convert user inputs to numbers
- Test with various combinations of numbers
