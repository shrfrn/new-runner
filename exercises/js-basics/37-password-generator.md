## Instructions
In this exercise, you will:
1. Implement a function named `generatePass(passLength)` which generates a password
2. The password should be of the specified length
3. The password should be made out of random digits and letters
4. Test your function with different lengths

## Example
If the function is called with:
- Input: 8

Expected output might be:
```
a7B9c2D4
```

If the function is called with:
- Input: 12

Expected output might be:
```
k5M9nP2qR7vX
```
