# Exercise 32: String Reversal

## Instructions
In this exercise, you will:
1. Read a string from the user
2. Print the string backwards using a loop
3. Do not use any built-in string reversal methods

## Example
If the user enters:
- Input: "Hello"

Expected output:
```
olleH
```

If the user enters:
- Input: "JavaScript"

Expected output:
```
tpircSavaJ
```

## Tips
- Think about how to access characters from the end of the string
- Consider how to build the reversed string character by character
