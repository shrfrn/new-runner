# Exercise 57: Matrix Mode

## Instructions
In this exercise, you will:
1. Implement the function `findMode(mat)` which finds the most common value in a matrix
2. The function should print the number which appear most frequently

## Example
For a matrix:
```
1  2  3
2  4  2
3  2  5
```
The function should print `2` because it appears 4 times, more than any other number.

## Bonus
Handle cases where there are multiple numbers with the same highest frequency by printing all of them.

## Example
```
1  2  3
2  4  3
3  2  5
```
The function should print `2, 3` because both appear 3 times, which is the highest frequency.

## Tips
- Consider using an object map to store the counts
