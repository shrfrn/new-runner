# Exercise 51: Word Count Map

## Instructions
In this exercise, you will:
1. Implement the function `countWordApperances(txt)` which returns an object map
2. The object keys will be the words in the string
3. The values will be the number of times each word appears in the string
4. The function should work with any valid string input

## Example
If the function is called with:
- Input: 'puki ben david and muki ben david'

Expected output:
```js
{
  puki: 1,
  ben: 2,
  david: 2,
  and: 1,
  muki: 1
}
```

## Tips
- Think about how to split the string into words
- Consider how to count word occurrences
