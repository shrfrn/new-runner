# Exercise 26: Ascending Random Numbers

## Instructions
In this exercise, you will:
1. Write a program that generates 10 ascending random numbers
2. Each number must be greater than the previously generated number
3. The first number should be in the range 0-1000
4. Each subsequent number should be in the range (previous number + 1) to (previous number + 1000)

## Example
If the program runs, it might generate numbers like:
```
First random number: 0-1000     => 100
Second random number: 101-1101  => 748
Third random number: 749-1749   => 1650
```

## Tips
- Think about how to generate random numbers within a specific range
- Consider how to ensure each number is greater than the previous one
