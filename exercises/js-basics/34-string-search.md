# Exercise 34: String Search

## Instructions
In this exercise, you will:
1. Implement the function `myIndexOf(str, searchStr)` which receives two strings
2. The function should return the index of the second string within the first
3. Return -1 if the second string is not found
4. Do not use the built-in `indexOf` function

## Example
If the function is called like this - `myIndexOf("Hello World", "World")`

Expected output:
```
6
```

If the function is called like this - `myIndexOf("Hello World", "xyz")`

Expected output:
```
-1
```

## Tips
- Think about how to check if one string contains another
- Consider how to handle empty strings
- What should happen if the search string is longer than the main string?
