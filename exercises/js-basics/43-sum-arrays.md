# Exercise 43: Sum Arrays

## Instructions
In this exercise, you will:
1. Write a function named `sumArrays` which receives two arrays and returns their sum
2. The function should work with arrays of different lengths
3. Each element in the result array should be the sum of corresponding elements from the input arrays
4. Create a helper function `getArrayFromUser` to read arrays from user input until 999 is entered

## Example
If the function is called with:
- Input: [1, 4, 3] & [2, 5, 1, 9]

Expected output:
```
[3, 9, 4, 9]
```

## Tips
- Think about how to handle arrays of different lengths
- Consider how to identify the shorter or longer array
- What should happen with empty arrays?
- Test your function with various inputs including:
  - Arrays of equal length
  - Arrays of different lengths
  - Empty arrays
  - Arrays with negative numbers
- The function should work with any valid arrays of numbers
