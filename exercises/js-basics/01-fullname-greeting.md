# Exercise 1: Full Name Greeting

## Instructions
In this exercise, you will:
1. Use `prompt()` to read a first name from the user
2. Use `prompt()` again to read a last name from the user
3. Declare a variable named `fullName` to store the complete name
4. Use `alert()` to display a welcome message to the user using their full name

## Example
If the user enters:
- First name: "John"
- Last name: "Smith"

Expected output:
```
Welcome, John Smith!
```

## Tips
- Store the user inputs in variables
- Think about how to combine the first and last names with a space between them
